Currently, I am a security engineer at Alibaba Cloud Security [XinHuo Lab](https://ti.aliyun.com/#/overview), focusing on malware detection, data security, etc.

I received my Master's degree in Computer Technology from the [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](https://cyber.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), China in 2022.


You can find my CV here: [Mingzhe Gao's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Mingzhe_Gao_Resume.pdf).


Research Interest
======
My current research interests primarily revolve around Software Security, System Security, and Data Mining. Specifically, I am deeply interested in the following areas: concept drift of malware detection, static analysis, code similarity, malware family taxonomy (encompassing both binary and script-based malware), and adversarial attacks against learning systems.

    <!-- - In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis to explore the severity of the malware mislabel issue, and try to rectify the description of malware generated from anti-virus engines. We first propose a malware label correction tool called RecMaL. It employs hybrid analyses for malware label rectifying. According to the thorough exploratory analysis, we figure out the core reasons for mislabeling issues and summarize them into 3 types. -->

    <!-- - In this work, we propose a static malware detection framework based on multi-feature ensemble learning. The experimental results show the detection accuracy of multi-feature multi-model aggregation algorithm can reach 96.99%, which prove the method has better malware identification ability than other static detection methods, and higher recognition rate for malwares using packing or obfuscation techniques. - 在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于多特征集合学习的静态恶意软件检测框架。实验结果表明，多特征多模型集合算法的检测准确率可达96.99%，对使用加壳或混淆技术的恶意软件具有更高的识别率。-->
