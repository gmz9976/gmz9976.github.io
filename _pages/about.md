Currently, I am a security engineer at Alibaba Cloud Security [XinHuo Lab](https://ti.aliyun.com/#/overview), focusing on malware detection, data security, etc.

I received my Master's degree in Computer Technology from the [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](https://cyber.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), China in 2022.


You can find my CV here: [Mingzhe Gao's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Mingzhe_Gao_Resume.pdf).


Research Interest
======
My current research interests mainly include Software Security, System Security and Data Mining. More specifically, my research interests include areas such as binary analysis, detection and family taxonomy of malware ( encompassing both binary and script ),  static program analysis, and adversarial attacks against learning systems.

Publications

2023
  - [Rectify the Malware Family Label via Hybrid Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167404823000871)
  - Wang Yang, **Mingzhe Gao***, Ligeng Chen, Zhengxuan Liu, Lingyun Ying
  - Computer & Security ( CCF B )
  - In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis to explore the severity of the malware mislabel issue, and try to rectify the description of malware generated from anti-virus engines. We first propose a malware label correction tool called RecMaL. It employs hybrid analyses for malware label rectifying. According to the thorough exploratory analysis, we figure out the core reasons for mislabeling issues and summarize them into 3 types.



2021
  - [A Malicious Code Static Detection Framework Based on Multi-Feature Ensemble Learning](https://crad.ict.ac.cn/cn/article/doi/10.7544/issn1000-1239.2021.20200912)
  - Wang Yang, **Mingzhe Gao***, Ting Jiang
  - Journal of computer research and development ( EI )
  - In this work, we propose a static malware detection framework based on multi-feature ensemble learning. The experimental results show the detection accuracy of multi-feature multi-model aggregation algorithm can reach 96.99%, which prove the method has better malware identification ability than other static detection methods, and higher recognition rate for malwares using packing or obfuscation techniques.
