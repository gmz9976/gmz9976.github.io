Currently, I am a security engineer at Alibaba Cloud Group, focusing on web/app crawler detection.

Before that, I received my M.Eng. from the [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](https://cyber.seu.edu.cn/), Southeast University in January 2022, advised by [Prof. Jian Gong](https://cyber.seu.edu.cn/gj1/list.htm) and [Ph.D. Wang Yang](https://cyber.seu.edu.cn/yw1/list.htm).

Research Interest
======
My current research interests primarily revolve around Software Security, System Security, and Data Mining. Specifically, I am deeply interested in the following areas: concept drift of malware detection, static analysis, code similarity, malware family taxonomy (encompassing both binary and script-based malware), and adversarial attacks against learning systems.
